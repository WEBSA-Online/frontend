						Alcohol and other substance use disorders (ASUDs) are a growing public
						health concern worldwide as it changes the functioning of the brain
						leading to physiological, psychological, and social problems. Substance
						abuse has a major impact on individuals, families, and communities, as its
						effects are cumulative, contributing to costly social, physical, and
						mental health problems. Several United Nations and national frameworks
						have been put in place to address the alcohol and drug abuse but they need
						research evidence to inform implementation. At the United Nations level
						there is the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3.0) that promotes healthy
						lives and well-being for all ages and specifically aims to strengthen the
						prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse
						and harmful use of alcohol by 2030. At the national level Uganda adopted
						SDG 3.0 in its National Development Plan III for the financial years
						2020/21 â€“ 2024/25, and plans to reduce the rates of Non-Communicable
						Diseases (NCD) by reducing the rates of alcohol abuse by 31%.
					</p>
					<p>
						The youth are among the populations most vulnerable to substance abuse
						since they are influenced by peer pressure and their nature to experiment.
						Substance abuse among the youth is on the rise in Uganda and immediate
						measures are needed to counter this. University students are another
						special kind of youth that are vulnerable to ASUD. A study carried out
						among students of 4 universities in Kampala in 2017 found that 29.5%
						smoked shisha while another study published in 2018 found that 40% of the
						university students were engaged in alcohol abuse
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite high levels of substance abuse accessibility to prevention and
						treatment services by young people in the country is low due to challenges
						ranging from human resource capital over infrastructural and logistic
						limitations to treatment and quality of care-related issues. There is only
						one national mental referral hospital and it has a specialisation on ASUD
						but it has only 30 beds and there is a lot of stigma associated with the
						services. This leaves the only option of private facilities which are too
						expensive for a common young person.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fortunately, there has been a growing evidence of successful use of
						web-based interventions to address substance abuse in different
						parts of the world. The study team proposes to assess the prevalence of
						substance abuse among the youths aged 18-24, develop a web-based
						intervention for the prevention and treatment of ASUD and assess the
						feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention on the youths with ASUD.
