			<h2>Practical Advice</h2>
			<p style={{}}>
				Here we provide you with clues on how to react when in tempting situations
				and this depends on the information you have so far provided from the
				screening assessment, the baseline, midline and weekly communications. A
				common example is when friends want to buy you excessive alcohol. You may
				say your family has a history of diabetes or hypertension or just alcohol
				addiction and thus you canâ€™t take the offer. You thank the friends and
				express hope to meet them again. You are further advised to improve
				self-efficacy beliefs and implementation intentions through acknowledging
				your success, observing your mentors, getting positive feedback, and
				practicing positive self-talk. Recording the incidents of alcohol and drug
				consumption helps monitor your progress to abstinence or reduction of
				alcohol/drug use disorder.
